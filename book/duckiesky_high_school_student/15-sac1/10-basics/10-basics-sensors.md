Certain sensors on the drone measure Pitch, Roll, and Yaw. The IMU measures roll and pitch; The camera measures yaw. 

Now, let's define some terms from the picture above.

Pitch- The rotation of the flying body around a side-to-side axis. It can be thought of as an “up and down”  motion.  
Roll- The motion of the flying body rocking back and forth. It can be thought of as the wings of a plane "tilting up or down".  

Yaw- The rotation of the flying body along a vertical axis. It can be thought of "twisting left and right".
