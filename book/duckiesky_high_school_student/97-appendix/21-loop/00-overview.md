# Closed Loop Control {#part:loop status=ready}

This section introduces feedback control systems, and describes the most commonly used feedback controller: the proportional integral derivative, or PID, controller. Although the mathematics behind this controller involve calculus, the high level understanding of the controller is actually quite intuitive. By the end of this section, you will program your own PID controller!
