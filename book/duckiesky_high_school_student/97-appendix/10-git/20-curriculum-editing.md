# Markdown and Contributions {#introduction-curriculum-editing status=ready}

## Learning Markdown 

- We're going to be learning Markdown and Markduck today, and at the end of the Unit, you are going to be able to directly submit some material to change our textbook!
    - Follow [this](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) tutorial to learn the basics of Markdown
        - Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

## Learning Markduck

- What is the difference between Markdown and Markduck?
    - Markduck is a Markdown dialect that is very similar to Markdown in terms of syntax. It is the language that the majority of the Duckiesky High School Textbook (including this document) was written in. Markduck has many characteristics that make it possible to create publication-worthy materials.
        - Syntax is a set of rules and characters that define interactions for a programming language. Individual syntaxes for programming languages can give various characters and code completely different meanings.
    - There are a couple key changes in the syntax between Markdown and Markduck, but, as a whole, almost all of the features you just learned in the Markdown tutorial remain the same! 
        - In Markduck, an unordered list is created by putting a dash (-) instead of (*).
        - Sublists are created by using tabs instead of spaces in Markduck.
        - In Markduck, headers are used to define pages and separate sections. For instance, the "2.2 Learning Markduck" section title is created with a heading of level two (##) whereas the title of this page "Markdown and Contributions" was created with a heading of level one (#).
    - [Read](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/duckumentation/out/markduck_basic.html) 1.5 Figures, 1.6 Subfigures, and 1.9 Comments.
    - Quickly skim over the section on [special characters](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/duckumentation/out/markduck_special_pars.html) to be aware of some of the other features that Markduck supports which you can't directly use in Markdown!

## Editing the DuckieSky Textbook 

Great! It's now time to put your newly acquired Markduck skills and GitHub skills from last lesson to use.

- You have the knowledge to propose changes to our curriculum!

Better: Exercise: Submit a pull request to change the next page __Unit A.2.3 - Students: Leave your mark here!__; Click on the the pencil in the top right corner of the page to be brought to our GitHub repo. View a video demo of an example pull request below.

Be creative but you should have in your edit:

1. Add a new section for yourself with a level two heading (##) or higher.
    - Don't use a level one heading (#) because that will create a new page!
2. Tell us why you are interested in this course!
3. Bold and/or italize words or phrases.
4. Use an ordered or unordered list.
5. Use a special tag to do something cool!

Once you submit a pull request, hopefully one of our team members will be able to approve it as quickly as possible!

### Helpful Materials to Propose Changes 

- [Here](https://youtu.be/MplifsKP7j0) is a video demoing an example edit to the student page. This walks you through the process of submitting a pull request on our repo, which you can use to propose direct edits to any Markduck page in our textbook.
    - As you learned in the last Unit, pull requests can be used to directly propose changes to a repository. Use this to propose changes anywhere in our textbook that you think you are able to improve (like a typo or a word/sentence/section). Don't worry too much about making an inaccurate change because a member of our team will always look over it before it goes through; just try your best! 
- [Here](https://youtu.be/eVYg8khGkWI) is a video that demonstrates how to open and close a GitHub issue on our textbook repository.
    - You can use GitHub Issues to propose alterations that deal with the structure and the hierarchical content of the textbook or to suggest changes that you are not in the position to fix yourself.

Again, thank you for helping us and the DuckieSky community!
