# Signals and Connections {#electronics-circuitry-signals status=ready}

__Analog signals__

Information can be transmitted through electricity:

- Encoding in voltage (Seen in an IR sensor)

- Encoding in frequency (Used for WiFi)

- Noise, which can come from various sources, can distort or block the information transmittion done by the former


__Digital signals__

Our number system uses base-10 (10 symbols) to represent numbers, but there are many other ways to convey information!

Thereâ€™s no reason we have to use 10 symbols, you can get away with just 2 -- binary! (or other numbers, eight: octal, sixteen: hexadecimal) Here's an ascii table that shows binary and decimal. [ascii table](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html)

Your teacher may assign you to construct a flippydo - a useful paper device that can help you translate our decimal system into binary!
